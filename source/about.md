Hi there!Â I'm Seiji, a **web developer** based in **New York City**. I know, it's confusing that I'm not actually a Ruby gem, but there is [one name after me](https://github.com/ipc103/seiji){:target="_blank"}.

I currently work on the engineering team at the **[Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com/){:target="_blank"}**, where I coincidentally went to school and learned how to become a web developer back in 2015.

Prior to that, I attended college and worked at a consultancy firm called
[Solver](http://solverusa.com){:target="_blank"} in the beautiful city of **Los
Angeles**.

My passions outside of programming include physical training, traveling
to foreign countries, reading, and spending time in the outdoors.

If you want to chat about anything, including my journey to become a web developer, feel free to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/snaganuma">shoot me a message</a>!
