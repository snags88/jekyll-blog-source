This has been on the top of my Trello board's to-do list, but I finally
got a new blog up and running. Since 3 months ago, I decided to
discontinue my Limitless blog and move off of Wordpress. It was just a
lot of unneccessary overhead and I also built the theme for that site
when I had no idea how to use html and css. Now I'm on that Jekyll +
Github pages game, serving up some static websites.

Also Jekyll is kind of nice in that I can write stuff in markdown, which
is way better than wrestling with friendly editor/raw html on
Wordpress's CMS. `Code` will be easier to read and we'll have some
syntax highlighting like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Seiji')
#=> prints 'Hi, Seiji' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

I went with a more minimalistic theme called
[dotX](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/dotx/) and have customized it to
fit my needs. No more crazy parallax effects on every page you visit!

I have the posts from my prior site backed up so I'll be backfilling
those as I get a chance. It'll also be fun and embarassing to read those posts again...
