# A Hitchhiker's Guide to Open Source Contributions

## Why do it?
- We'd all be solving the same problems over and over, not making any progress on solving the complex problems of the world
- Give back to the community that allows you to do your job (or hobby)
- Build empathy towards other developers, hopefully extending to your daily life

## How to do it?
- Start small to build confidence (don't go for big dog repos like Rails, React, etc.) Maybe improving documentation first
- Move on to contributing to libraries you use and found a pain point in
- Engage in the dialogue (if there is one)
- Check the contribution guidelines on the README
- Write specs (even if it's not required)
- Commit and prosper
